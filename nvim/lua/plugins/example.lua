-- since this is just an example spec, don't actually load anything here and return an empty spec
-- stylua: ignore
if true then return {} end

-- every spec file under the "plugins" directory will be loaded automatically by lazy.nvim
-- In your plugin files, you can:
-- * add extra plugins
-- * disable/enabled LazyVim plugins
-- * override the configuration of LazyVim plugins
 -- since `vim.tbl_deep_extend`, can only merge tables and not lists, the code above
--  every ullas every ullas
